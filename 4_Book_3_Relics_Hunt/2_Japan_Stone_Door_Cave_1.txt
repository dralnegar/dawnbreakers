A shriek, high and thin and impossibly sharp, slices through the chamber.

Billy flinches—his breath catches—and he turns toward it.

In the space where Stefan stood: light, flickering and failing.

Billy sees Stefan's outline—eyes wide, reaching for him—before the skin begins to slip from his face, peeling away in glistening tears.

His hair lifts, sifting like sand.

His chest collapses inward. Fingers blacken. Eyes melt.

The glow that was Stefan—the light that once reached Billy across woods, through silence, through pain—dims and dies.

In three seconds, the boy Billy loves disintegrates before him.

His bones clatter to the floor with a brutal, hollow thud.

Silence presses in.

And then Billy screams.

Not in fear. Not in anger.

In absolute, irreversible grief:

“NOOOOOO!”

Billy whispers: “I just got him…”

“I JUST GOT HIM!”

“HE DIDN’T EVEN GET TO LIVE!”

“HE DIDN’T EVEN GET A CHANCE!”

“I LET HIM GET CLOSE! I LET MYSELF HOPE!”

“I SHOULD’VE KNOWN!”

His collapse, desperation, and the sense of complete soul-break are now present and accurate

They’d only taken a few steps inside the sealed chamber.

The door closed behind them with a sigh, and the air turned to iron.

Shadows thickened. Not in shape, but in presence.

Billy (internal monologue):
Something’s wrong. No — rotten. Pulled. This place is bleeding and it’s not letting me out.

Then a shriek. Not from the cave. From Stefan.

Billy turned.

He blinked — once.

Stefan was gone.

His clothes fell first — like paper folding.
His skin melted like candlewax.
Hair rose like smoke.
And then — bones.
Just bones.

BILLY (screaming):
“NOOO! STEFAN—STEFAAAN!”

He ran.
Screamed again.
Voice breaking apart like smoke in winter air.

He burst back out the stone door, collapsing in the dell, sobbing.

🖤 EXT. FOREST DELL — PSYCHIC REALITY
Time no longer moves forward. Only downward.

The forest rots in front of him.
Leaves shrivel.
Stars fall.
Soil sours.

He hasn’t moved. He can’t.

Billy (monologue):
He’s gone. I saw it. I felt it. I should’ve shielded him. He trusted me. Rael trusted me.

His palms are scraped raw.
His light has vanished.
His cape folds around him like a burial shroud.

Then come the voices.

First — a whisper that sounds like his mother:

“Billy… you always were the sad one, weren’t you?
Even as a child. You tried so hard to shine.
But sweet boy… stars die too.”

Then Kenwapep’s voice:

“You’ve done enough damage.”
“How many timelines did you break?”
“You were never meant to exist.”
“You are chaos pretending to be kindness.”
“Everything you love will be ash, Wiccan.”
“You are the storm that leaves no shelter.”

Billy (broken whisper):
“…I’m sorry, Stefan.”

He places a dying spell on his chest.

A rush of cold.
A crack of nothingness.
Breath shortens.
Magic drains.

The world fades to silver-grey.

And then — black.

🧠 STEFAN — INSIDE THE CHAMBER
Stefan feels the collapse immediately — not of magic, but of Billy.

He tries to move — but a psychic barrier holds him.

He watches Billy run, but cannot call out.

Stefan (internal):
“Not again. Not this time. Not him.”

He presses both hands against the barrier. Then shoulder. Then chest.

The barrier pulses.

And then the whispers come — not to Billy, but to him:

“Let him go. You cannot follow everyone into the dark.”
“You were made to witness. That is all the Scribe can do.”
“Record his fall.”

Stefan (whispers):
“No.”
