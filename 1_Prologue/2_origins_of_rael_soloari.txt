INT. ABANDONED SANCTUARY – NIGHT

A quiet room. Cracked walls, scattered dust. Silence thick as ash.

Rael sits cross-legged at the center—barefoot, shirtless, a circle of unlit candles around him. His chest rises slowly with each breath.

He closes his eyes.

From his core, a pulse of golden warmth spreads outward. The flame begins beneath his sternum. With each breath, a candle flickers to life—one by one, measured and calm.

A soft hum builds beneath his breath—like ancient wind against temple stone.

His voice begins—not loud. Not rehearsed. But remembered.

RAEL (V.O.)
"I was not born into greatness. I was born into silence."

FLASH – EXT. TEMPLE OF AMUN – 18TH DYNASTY – DAY

Golden sun cuts through tall pillars. The young priest, robed in linen, kneels in reverence. He scrubs the temple floor, head bowed, silent among chanting priests.

RAEL (V.O.)
"I remember the temple floors—cold beneath my knees. The hymns we sang to empty chambers. The way sunlight touched the stone, but never seemed to stay."

FLASH – INT. TEMPLE INNER SANCTUM – NIGHT

The nameless priest kneels before a dark altar. Eyes closed. Stillness.

Bowed in silent prayer before Amun, he feels a sudden warmth stir the air. A presence builds—not imagined, but real. The stillness deepens. Behind the altar, light begins to rise—and from it, Amun-Ra emerges, not in flesh, but in form: a figure of golden flame and calm authority. The radiance pulses slowly, rhythmic as breath, alive with ancient memory.

AMUN-RA (V.O.) (booming, but kind)
"You have served in silence. Now, you will shine."

BACK TO SANCTUARY

The flames now surround him—steady, golden. Shadows stretch.

RAEL (V.O.)
"I was a priest of Amun. I asked nothing. Wanted little. I served, because service gave me shape."

"Until He gave me purpose."

"Amun-Ra, god of gods. He came not with thunder—but with clarity."

"He told me the world was shifting. That a Pharaoh had risen—one who dared to believe that divinity could be one. Singular. Undivided."

FLASH – EXT. COURT OF THE PHARAOH – DAY

Pharaoh Akhenaten, arms raised to the Aten. Walls stripped of the old gods’ symbols. The priest, in ceremonial gold robes, walks behind him. His skin glows faintly. He walks in silence, unseen yet revered—become not a figure, but a focus. The people's worship no longer reaches to a distant sun, but rises in prayer to the divine light he now carries. A god not seen, but believed in. A protector shaped from faith itself.

AMUN-RA (V.O.)
"While this Pharaoh reigns, you shall carry my flame. You shall become what I cannot."

BACK TO SANCTUARY

Rael’s brow glistens with sweat. His expression: peaceful, but burdened.

RAEL (V.O.)
"I was to become the Aten. A flame to burn away the old world."

"But all things pass. Pharaohs die. Faith becomes dust."

"And I… I was laid down like a weapon no longer needed."

FLASH – EXT. DESERT TOMB – DUSK

The priest, now older, walks the edge of the desert under a dimming sky. The Pharaoh Akhenaten has died. His young son—Tutankhaten—has taken the throne.

RAEL (V.O.)
"A boy-king crowned in the name of the Aten. But already, the priests of the old gods gathered in the shadows. The return of Amun was written in their silence."

RAEL (V.O.)
"And when the name Tutankhaten was shed… and the boy was renamed Tutankhamun… I knew my time had ended."

The priest enters a hidden tomb. He removes his priestly mantle, lays it on the stone, and lies down. The light in his chest dims—only a flicker remains.

Then—light fills the chamber. Amun-Ra appears once more, radiant and solemn.

AMUN-RA (V.O.)
"Your flame will sleep now. But not extinguish. When the darkness rises, so too shall you."

He kneels beside the priest and touches his brow.

AMUN-RA (V.O.)
"You shall awaken with a name. Not as Aten. Not as god. But as one who remembers."

A final pulse of golden light.

AMUN-RA (V.O.)
"Rael Solari."

The chamber dims. The priest—Rael—sleeps, his name sealed in silence until the world forgets the light.

BACK TO SANCTUARY

Rael opens his eyes. Gold flickers—then softens. Human again.

He rises. Walks to the window. The city glows faintly in the distance.

RAEL (V.O.)
"He told me the ancient darkness would return. Not as armies. Not as gods. But as silence. As the forgetting of what light means."

"And when that day came… I would awaken."

BACK TO SANCTUARY

Rael places his palm on the wall. Light pulses outward like a ripple.

RAEL (V.O.)
"Not as Aten. Not as a god. But as Rael Solari. A man. A flicker. A warning."

"I do not burn to be worshipped."

"I burn so others might see the dawn… and choose to rise."

FADE TO BLACK.
