EXT. MOTORWAY OVERPASS – NIGHT
The wind howls.
Cars flash by beneath, headlights streaking like ghosts across the wet road.

Stefan stands on the ledge of the overpass. Hoodie up, hands trembling. Below him, the world roars past—fast, blind, uncaring.

His eyes are glassy. His lips pressed into a thin, desperate line.

FLASHBACKS (ABOVE THE SOUND OF RUSHING CARS):

— Laughter in the hallway.
“Hey lover boy, looking for Peter?”
Brian’s voice. Sharp. Mocking.
Phones out. Everyone watching. No one helping.

— His grandmother’s smile.
Weak. Tired. But always trying.
“Don’t worry about dinner, love. Just rest. You’ve got school tomorrow.”

— Peter’s kindness.
A small wave in class.
The only person who looked him in the eyes that day.

BACK TO BRIDGE – PRESENT

STEFAN (whispers)
“It doesn’t matter.”
“I don’t matter.”

He closes his eyes. Takes a shaky breath. One foot inches forward.

Then—warmth.

Not physical. Not from the air. It bubbles in his chest—like a memory he doesn’t have, like a hug he’s never known.

His eyes snap open.

The light from the streetlamp flickers—then steadies. Golden. Soft. Alive.

Behind him:

A voice. Gentle. Ancient. Real.

RAEL
“Do you truly believe the world would be better… without one more light?”

Stefan turns.
There, leaning against the railing like he’s been there forever, is a man. Dressed simply. No halo, no divine thunder. Just kindness and gravity. Rael.

Stefan blinks, startled, but not afraid.

STEFAN
“…Who are you?”

Rael doesn’t answer immediately. He walks closer—but stops a safe distance away.

RAEL
“I’ve seen stars burn out. I’ve watched entire cities vanish from time. But never—not once—have I seen a soul quite like yours.”

(beat)
“You feel everything. That’s not a curse, Stefan. That’s how light gets in.”

Stefan stares at him. Unsure. Anger boiling beneath the tears.

STEFAN
“You don’t know what it’s like.”

RAEL (softly)
“I do.”

“I’ve watched empires fall because people believed they didn’t matter. I’ve lived lifetimes inside silence, waiting for someone like you… to remind the world that kindness still fights.”

The golden light pulses again. This time from Stefan. Barely there—but Rael notices.

He holds out his hand.

RAEL
“Come down. Not because the pain isn’t real. But because you are.”

Stefan stares. Breathing sharp. The tears come, but he nods—just barely—and steps down.

Rael doesn’t embrace him.

He walks beside him. Quiet. Present. Real.

FADE OUT.
