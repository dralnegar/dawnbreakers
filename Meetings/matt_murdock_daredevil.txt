INT. JOSIE’S BAR – NIGHT

The low murmur of a half-full bar hums around Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson, seated in their usual corner booth. Matt’s glass is untouched. Foggy’s mid-story, hands animated.

FOGGY
I’m just saying, for a blind guy, you still always manage to win every debate we ever have. I want a rematch—with a real judge this time.

MATT (smirks)
Is that why you ordered three drinks ahead? Tactical confidence?

Foggy chuckles, about to reply—
—when Matt’s expression changes. Subtle. His head tilts.

FOGGY
Oh no. That’s your “I heard something horrible a mile away” face.

MATT
...Something’s moving under 12th and Bleeker. Heavy. Fast. Not... right.

He rises, pulling his cane.

FOGGY (sighs)
Let me guess. “Stay here, Foggy.” Right?

MATT
Stay here, Foggy.

EXT. SEWER ENTRANCE – NIGHT

A manhole cover hangs half-lifted. The stench of rot and sulfur wafts up.

Matt slides in silently. The darkness swallows him.

INT. SEWERS – MOMENTS LATER

The air is dense with chanting—low, guttural. Echoes of Latin twisted by some deeper tongue.

Matt, now in Daredevil gear, stalks forward. Flickering torchlight reveals hooded cultists gathered in a circle. Something writhes at the center—an altar of bone and black ichor.

One cultist turns—eyes empty. Black veins spider through his face.

CULTIST (in a rasped whisper)
The Aten burns false. Only shadow endures.

Suddenly they lunge. The fight begins—tight quarters, claws, knives, whispered curses.

Daredevil weaves between attacks—blows precise. But then—

—one cultist begins to levitate, shadows wrapping around him like armor.

CULTIST (LEADER)
You dare interrupt our awakening? You blind fool!

As he raises a blade dripping in void-light, a beam of golden brilliance crashes down through a sewer grate above, vaporizing part of the altar.

A figure descends through the light, barefoot, robed in flowing white and gold. His eyes glow like twin suns.

RAEL SOLARI
He dares. And he is not alone.

The shadows hiss at Rael’s presence—retreating like frightened rats.

Matt pauses—his senses overwhelmed for a beat. The heat. The sound of Rael’s heart—it pulses like a hymn.

DAREDEVIL
Who the hell are you?

RAEL
Someone who sees what you do in darkness... and has come to see if your light is worthy to burn brighter.

They fight together now—Rael’s solar flares disintegrate curses mid-air, Daredevil’s batons shatter bones. It's elegance and brutality in harmony.

The cult disperses. But something deeper stirs—this was just an opening act.


Let’s revise and deepen the scene with that dynamic in mind:

INT. SEWERS – NIGHT

The chanting grows louder. Daredevil moves like a shadow through tighter tunnels. The air crackles—not just with ritual, but with something older waking up.

Then—he feels it. A psychic pull, not from outside, but within. A knot of emotion tightens in his chest—fear, anger... guilt.

DAREDEVIL (V.O.)
Not now. Not him.

But it’s already too late.

As cultists swarm, one hurls a blade dipped in black fire. Matt twists to dodge—just barely.

CULTIST
Your penance comes, red devil!

Suddenly—a soft pulse. Like a bell rung beneath the world.

RAEL arrives—not descending from the sky, but simply there, his presence folding out of light at Matt’s side. Like he walked through a door no one else can see.

His voice is calm—but unmistakable.

RAEL
You called me.

DAREDEVIL (gritted)
I didn’t mean to.

RAEL
You didn’t have to.

A moment between them. No time for more.

A summoned creature lunges from the shadows—tentacles wrapped in scripture inked in blood.

Rael raises his hand, and from his palm erupts a narrow ray of solar fire, surgical and precise. It sears the creature, but leaves the stone untouched.

RAEL (to Matt)
You fight like a man seeking punishment. But you know this isn’t about you.

DAREDEVIL (dodging blows)
Don’t start preaching down here, I’ve already got company.

RAEL
Then allow me to listen instead.

Rael closes his eyes—letting the room fill with golden light. The cultists recoil in agony, their dark wards unraveling. Matt takes advantage—disarming one, flipping another into the water with brutal grace.

Together, they dismantle the ritual—Rael burning through occult barriers, Matt finishing each foe with unerring accuracy.

When it’s done, steam and silence fill the chamber.

Matt wipes blood from his brow.

DAREDEVIL
You always show up when I don’t want you to.

RAEL
And never when you think you need me.

Rael steps past him, gazing at the ruined altar.

RAEL (quietly)
Something’s clawing at the veil. This was not the full hand... just a finger.

He turns back to Matt.

RAEL
We’ll need to go deeper than this. Together.

DAREDEVIL (after a pause)
Then we better talk to the others.
