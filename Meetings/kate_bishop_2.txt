EXT. ROOFTOPS – NIGHT

KATE BISHOP glides along the rooftops with practiced ease. The city hums beneath her—taxis, late-night sirens, distant club bass. But she’s tuned in to something else entirely.

KATE (V.O.)
Last night was weird. Cosmic-weird. But I figured I’d sweat it out with some old-school street work.

Thwip. Grapple line fires.

KATE (V.O.)
Nothing clears the head like bad guys and stolen purses.

Suddenly—a scream.

From below. A young voice.

GIRL (O.S.)
Let me go!

Kate freezes, pivots.

KATE (V.O.)
Every damn time.

She leaps.

EXT. BACK ALLEY – CONTINUOUS

A man bolts through the alley clutching a young girl—8 or 9 years old, kicking and screaming. He’s fast, desperate.

Kate lands ahead of them, bow already drawn.

KATE
Hey, creep! Wrong city.

The man swerves down a narrower side alley—panicked, muttering.

KIDNAPPER (ragged)
No, no, not again—please, not again!

Kate gives chase—boots pounding pavement.

EXT. SIDE ALLEY – MOMENTS LATER

The man turns the corner sharply—then screams.

KIDNAPPER (O.S.)
No! No, no—it’s too bright! Make it stop!

Kate rounds the same corner at full speed—

—and stops dead.

The alley is bathed in a warm, golden glow that shouldn't exist. Not here. Not now.

The kidnapper is on his knees, clutching his face, sobbing.

The little girl stands unharmed—calm, even curious. A veil of soft light surrounds her like a protective shell.

And in front of her—

RAEL SOLARI, barefoot, his eyes glowing like dawn through smoke.

He stands still, one hand raised—not in threat, but in mercy. The light flows through him, centered on the child. The alley’s trash and graffiti seem to blur, softened by a light that doesn’t burn, but reveals.

KATE (quietly)
You again.

Rael turns, his expression unreadable.

RAEL
You were meant to follow.

KATE
You’re following me, sunshine.

RAEL (glancing at the child)
I follow where pain stirs light.

The girl looks at Rael in awe, then slowly runs to Kate, hugging her legs.

GIRL (whispering)
He didn’t let the bad man hurt me.

Kate wraps an arm around her, eyes never leaving Rael.

KATE (to Rael)
You blinded him?

RAEL
I let him see.

The kidnapper groans on the ground—his eyes open now, but different. Not blind. Broken. Like he’s seen something too good for someone like him.

KIDNAPPER (mumbling)
I saw... I saw me. I saw what I was.

Sirens wail faintly in the distance.

Rael begins to walk past Kate.

RAEL
The light doesn’t choose sides. It simply reveals what is.

Kate watches him go, stunned for once.

KATE
You’re not done with me, are you?

He pauses just long enough.

RAEL
No. Not until you choose what kind of light you want to be.

Then he vanishes around the corner, the glow disappearing with him.

EXT. ROOFTOP ABOVE – MINUTES LATER

Kate sits with the girl, now safe, waiting for police.

She looks out over the city, more uncertain than ever.

KATE (V.O.)
I’ve fought aliens, gods, street gangs.
But I’ve never met someone who looks at you like they already know the ending—and they’re waiting to see if you’ll change it.

She exhales.

KATE (V.O.)
What the hell are you, Rael?

INT. MATT’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

A knock.

Matt, dressed down in a simple T-shirt and sweats, tilts his head as he approaches the door. He already knows who it is—heartbeat steady but sharp, like a string pulled too tight.

He opens the door.

MATT
Kate.

KATE (walking in without invitation)
Hey, counselor.

MATT (closing the door)
You’re not exactly the “drop by for tea” type.

KATE
Nope. Not unless the tea’s spiked and the host is hiding a glowing sun-man.

Matt freezes just slightly.

Kate catches it.

KATE (circling the room)
So. Let’s skip the warm-up. You’ve seen him. You know something about what he is. You just didn’t think I would.

MATT
I didn’t think you were supposed to.

KATE
Oh, good. You’re doing the cryptic prophet thing too now.

She drops into a chair.

KATE
He saved a kid last night. Saved me, kind of. Not with fists. Not with tech. Just... with whatever the hell he is.

Matt walks to the window, back turned.

MATT
He’s not like us.

KATE
Yeah. I got that. What I didn’t get is why you didn’t mention him at Josie’s. You knew. And you didn’t say a word.

Matt sighs. Long, heavy.

MATT
Because I didn’t want to pull anyone else into this. Because I’ve seen what happens to people who get too close to him.

KATE (leaning forward)
So you have history.

MATT
More like... unfinished penance.

He finally turns.

MATT
He’s not just some vigilante with a flashy aura. He’s tied to something ancient. Dangerous. Every time he shows up, it’s because the world is starting to tip.

KATE
Tip into what?

MATT
That’s the part I don’t know. But I trust my gut—and my gut says Rael Solari isn’t here for show.

Kate stands.

KATE
Well, he’s seen me now. Said I have a choice coming. Like he’s reading my future off a teleprompter made of stars.

MATT (quietly)
He does that.

KATE
So... what now?

MATT
Now? You keep doing what you do. You help people. You fight for the ones no one else sees.

KATE (dry)
And wait for the sun-god to reappear like a moody phoenix?

Matt almost smiles.

MATT
Pretty much.

Kate heads for the door. Stops. Looks back.

KATE
You trust him?

MATT
I don’t know if I trust him.
But I trust what he brings out in people. Especially the ones he doesn’t choose by accident.

Kate lingers on that. Then nods, and slips out.
