EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING THE CITY – NIGHT

Kate stands on a rooftop ledge, overlooking Manhattan. Her bow hangs loosely from her shoulder. The skyline glows—but she’s looking for a different light.

KATE (V.O.)
I’m good at reading people. Tells. Microexpressions. Vibe shifts.
But him? He’s not a puzzle. He’s a mirror—and I hate what I see in it.

Behind her, golden light flickers—soft and soundless. She turns, not startled.

RAEL SOLARI stands there—not glowing as before, but calm, grounded. Human.

RAEL
You came looking.

KATE (arms crossed)
You knew I would.

RAEL
I hoped.

He walks to the ledge beside her, gazing out at the city.

RAEL
You look at the city like it’s yours to protect.

KATE
It’s not mine. But someone has to try.

RAEL
You try harder than most.

Kate eyes him, frustrated and fascinated.

KATE
Okay. Cards on the table. Who are you really? No poetry. No riddles. I’ve had enough riddles to fill a Batcave.

Rael breathes in, slow.

RAEL
I am Rael Solari.
I am not a god, though people once thought so.
I am not a hero, though I’ve stood among them.
I am... the echo of a promise made long before this world forgot the sun has a voice.

Kate stares. She wants to roll her eyes—but can’t.

KATE
So... you’re some celestial... light-being? Why now? Why show up here? Why me?

Rael turns to her, and for the first time, the light in his eyes dims. He’s not dazzling—he’s honest.

RAEL
Because this world is bending. And when it breaks, it won’t be in fire. It will be in silence. The kind of silence where hope dies quietly.

He steps closer.

RAEL (cont’d)
The ones I’ve seen rise before this moment—gods, kings, titans—they shine like stars.
But you, Kate Bishop, shine like a flare. Closer. Sharper. You light up the dark for others, even when you can’t see the way yourself.

Kate’s throat tightens, unexpectedly.

KATE
I’m just a girl with a bow. And a lot of issues.

RAEL (softly)
You’re a Dawnbreaker.

She lets that hang in the air.

KATE
That sounds like a comic book.

RAEL
This world is starting to feel like one.

He extends a hand—not glowing, not imposing. Just... offered.

RAEL
I won’t force you. You don’t owe me anything. But if you walk with me, you’ll help decide what tomorrow looks like. For all of us.

Kate stares at his hand. Breathes.

KATE
You’re lucky I like dramatic rooftop speeches.

She takes his hand.

KATE (cont’d)
Let’s go break some dawn.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY – THE DOCKS – NIGHT

The air smells like salt and rust. Water slaps against the pier. Everything feels still, heavy, like the night is holding its breath.

DAREDEVIL stands on the edge of a long-abandoned warehouse rooftop, masked, listening. His head turns slightly as soft footsteps approach behind him.

KATE (O.S.)
This where the cool kids brood now?

DAREDEVIL (without turning)
Only the ones being hunted by metaphysical sun gods.

KATE
Good. Was worried I was the only one not getting enough sleep.

She steps up beside him, pulling down her hood. They both stare out at the black river.

KATE (cont’d)
So. You’ve seen him more than once?

DAREDEVIL
Rael? Yeah. First time I felt him before I saw him.
Like the city held its breath and whispered: he’s here.

KATE
I hate how accurate that is.

A quiet beat between them.

KATE (cont’d)
He’s not like Thor or Strange. He’s not swinging hammers or rewriting reality. He feels like something that’s supposed to be here. But isn’t.

DAREDEVIL
Because he’s not here to fight a villain.

KATE (turning to him)
Then what is he here to fight?

Matt hesitates.

DAREDEVIL
I think… he’s here to stop the dark.
Not shadows. Not crime. The dark that waits underneath everything.

Kate exhales slowly, eyes distant.

KATE
He said I was a flare. You think that means something?

DAREDEVIL
It means you burn. Even when you’re not sure who for.

Kate glances at him, surprised by the clarity. Matt offers a small shrug.

DAREDEVIL
He told me the same, once. Except mine wasn’t a flare.
He said I was a blade in a blind man’s hand.

Kate chuckles dryly.

KATE
Guy really knows how to make you feel both seen and existentially exposed.

Suddenly—

A quiet shift in the wind. A warmth. A pulse in the air.

They both feel it. No sound, no footsteps—but they know.

Kate slowly turns.

RAEL SOLARI stands a few feet away on the rooftop—no glow, no drama. Just presence. Calm, collected, endless.

RAEL
You came together. Good.

KATE
You always sneak up like this?

RAEL (smiling faintly)
You call it sneaking. I call it arriving in silence.

Matt steps forward.

DAREDEVIL
Why now? Why the three of us?

Rael moves toward them, his voice gentle but steady.

RAEL
Because balance begins with trust.
You walk in law, Matt Murdock. You walk in instinct, Kate Bishop.
And I walk between them—where both must stand together if the dawn is to come.

KATE
Okay, so… is this where you tell us there’s some ancient evil rising, and we’re chosen warriors?

RAEL (tilting his head)
Not chosen. Aligned. Your light resonates. That’s why it drew me.
And why the dark will try to smother it soon.

DAREDEVIL (quietly)
We’ve felt it.

RAEL
Good. Then you’re ready to stand.

Kate looks between them both. Still a little skeptical, but something deep in her is steadying. Ready.

KATE
Alright, prophet. You’ve got my arrow.
But if I start glowing and floating, I’m billing you for a new wardrobe.

RAEL (smirking)
Noted.

DAREDEVIL
And if this darkness comes for us?

RAEL (serious now)
Then we meet it not as prey.
But as Dawnbreakers.

The wind stirs again—just enough to ruffle their clothes, as if the city agrees.
