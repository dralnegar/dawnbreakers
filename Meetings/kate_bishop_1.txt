INT. JOSIE’S BAR – LATER THAT NIGHT

Foggy nurses the same beer. He checks his watch. Then the door swings open and in walks MARCI STAHL, radiant in business-casual defiance of Josie’s dim glow.

Beside her—KATE BISHOP, dressed in a leather jacket, black jeans, and that unmistakable air of someone who’s just passing through but sees everything.

FOGGY (standing quickly)
Marci. Hey—wow. I thought you said you were coming alone.

MARCI (grinning)
You know I hate walking the city alone after dark.

KATE (offhand, scanning the bar)
She saw three rats on the same pizza slice and panicked.

FOGGY
You brought Hawkeye for rats?

KATE (dry)
I’m not the rat-fighting kind. Unless they’re six feet tall and Russian.

They settle in, Kate casually clocking exits, clientele, and Foggy’s nervous energy. She eyes the empty booth.

KATE
So… where’s the blind guy?

MARCI
He still working?

FOGGY (dodging)
Uh… probably just got caught up. You know how Matt is. Always someone needing saving or suing.

INT. JOSIE’S BAR – MOMENTS LATER

The door creaks open.

Matt steps in, trench coat hiding the torn sleeve beneath. He moves carefully, too smoothly. Only someone like Kate would notice the limp he’s hiding.

FOGGY (relieved)
There he is. Thought I’d have to lie to another waitress about you being dead again.

MATT (dry)
Give it time.

He turns—freezes for half a second as he senses the new presence. Sharp. Young. Watchful.

KATE (already smiling)
You’re taller than I expected. Also... look like you’ve been in a fight with a brick wall.

MATT (charmed but guarded)
Most walls hit back harder than you'd think.
(extends a hand)
Matt Murdock.

KATE
Kate Bishop. Marci’s tagalong. And professional people-reader.

She shakes his hand. Her brow furrows—something’s off with him. His pulse, the subtle tension in his grip.

KATE (curious)
So what’s your excuse for being late? Swamped at work? Or did Hell’s Kitchen actually live up to its name tonight?

MATT (evasively)
Let’s just say... it was a little darker than usual out there.

Kate raises an eyebrow but says nothing. She knows how to read a room—and how not to push when someone’s bleeding under the surface.

LATER – SAME BOOTH

The group chats, but Matt is quiet. He listens more than he speaks.

Kate eventually gets up to leave, slinging her bag over one shoulder.

KATE (to Matt)
You owe me a story next time. I can smell secrets, y’know.

MATT (with a faint smile)
Be careful where you look. Some secrets bite.

KATE (grinning back)
I’ve been bitten before.

She exits with Marci, but not before giving Matt one last glance. Something about him… feels tethered to something bigger.

INT. JOSIE’S – MOMENTS LATER

FOGGY
You good?

MATT (quiet)
No. But I think help’s coming.

He fingers the edge of a coaster, the faint heat of Rael’s presence still echoing in his chest.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY – NIGHT

KATE BISHOP walks alone now, weaving her usual backtrack route through the city—detours and random turns, a practiced dance to shake off tails she doesn’t have.

She tugs her jacket tighter against the breeze.

KATE (V.O.)
Same rhythm. Same concrete. Same shadows. You think you’ve seen it all—until something feels... off.

As she turns a corner toward her block, something different prickles at her senses—not the usual city paranoia. It’s warmth. Faint, but unnatural for midnight.

She pauses. Narrows her eyes.

A soft, amber glow flickers down a narrow alley to her right—not electrical, not firelight. More like the kind of warmth you feel under your skin.

KATE (V.O.)
This is the part where someone tells me don’t go in there.

She steps into the alley.

EXT. ALLEYWAY – CONTINUOUS

It's quiet. No wind. The city seems to hush itself. The glow emanates from around a corner—pulsing gently, like a heartbeat. No sound, but the air vibrates.

Kate draws a compact baton from her bag—nothing threatening, just habit. She rounds the corner—

—and there he is.

RAEL SOLARI sits on a low crate at the alley’s end, bathed in warm golden light that doesn’t come from any visible source. He's shirtless, faint glowing cracks across his chest like fault lines leaking dawnlight. His eyes are closed. He’s... waiting.

KATE (tightening her grip on the baton)
Okay. Either you’re a cosmic yoga instructor, or I’ve wandered into a cult recruitment commercial.

RAEL (without opening his eyes)
You’re not afraid.

KATE
I’ve met Norse gods, alien dogs, and a guy who talks to ants. You’re gonna have to try harder than “mysterious lightshow guy.”

RAEL (opening his eyes slowly)
You were curious. That’s more important.

KATE (eyeing him)
You know my name?

RAEL (nods)
And you know mine. Not yet with your mind—but your soul is already turning toward me.

KATE
That’s... creepy. Poetic. But creepy.

Rael stands slowly, the glow retreating just enough to show the full detail of his robes now forming across his body like spun sunlight. His presence is intense, but gentle.

RAEL
You walk with shadows, but carry light.
The others don’t know what you are yet. Not fully. But I do.

KATE (blinking)
Alright, prophet-man, let’s start over. Who are you?

RAEL (softly)
Rael Solari. A sun born in flesh.

KATE (deadpan)
Cool. Any chance you’re also just a weird street performer?

RAEL (smiling)
Would that make this easier?

KATE
A little.

RAEL
Then yes. Let’s say I’m just someone passing through.

KATE
Passing through... my alley.

She lowers her baton slightly.

RAEL
You will have a choice soon, Kate Bishop. One most won't even see coming. And when it arrives, I hope you remember this light. Because it remembers you.

The glow around him pulses once—and then fades, as if absorbed back into the shadows. He’s gone.

Kate stares at the empty space for a beat.

KATE (V.O.)
Alright. That’s gonna be someone’s problem tomorrow. Probably mine.

She walks off into the night—more alert than before, and a little less certain that she’s alone in the city anymore.
